# Complete Free Coding Bootcamp with the MERN Stack (beginner friendly) 

This is a series video and we are going to build a full-stack application from scratch using the MERN STACK (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Nodejs).

We will build a <strong>Sports Web App</strong> that allows you creating sports events and the app will include:

* User registration and authentication (maybe add facebook/gmail login if the series becomes popular) 
* Hashing password for security 
* Session control
* CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete) 
* Search for events using filters (Running, Cycling or Swimming) 
* Sign UP for event in order to participate
* Upload images to the server
* Website notification using web sockets (in order to approve or refuse the Event Sign UP request)
